### Overview

**EpochFrame** is a C++ library for tabular data manipulation inspired by Pandas, using [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) as its core in-memory representation. It offers CPU-based data structures (`Series` and `DataFrame`) that wrap Arrowâ€™s arrays and tables, plus a consistent interface for indexing, slicing, rolling, groupby, and more. Future plans include supporting GPU backends (cudf) or specialized finance features (hosseinmoein/dataframe).
